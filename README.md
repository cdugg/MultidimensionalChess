**On Hold for School**

Hello this is what I'm working on right now in spare time.

The goal is to make a webpage where higher dimensional chess can be explained for the general public, visualized, and played for a limited amount of dimensions.
I want to design the game logic so that it can be applied to any higher dimension. Meaning all pieces movement will need to be defined in terms of matricies and chebyshev distances. This means apart from just movement definitions the game logic that checks for checks and check mates will need to be created such that they can account for checks and mates from any dimension.

From there I will make 4x4x4x4 games as well as 8x8x4, and 8x8x8 playable in a visual format using three.js. After that I want to implement a 5D game using time as the 5th dimension, but optimization could prove to be very difficult. Then maybe I will implement a bot to play against. 

Note: three.js will not run in browser unless site is hosted (i.e. python3 -m http.server -> localhost:8000)
